# open-source-Book-Data-Web-Scraping-and-Kaggle-Contribution
 This project focuses on web scraping book data from a website and contributing it as an open-source dataset on Kaggle. Using Python with libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests, I extracted essential book information, including titles, authors, ratings, prices, and availability.
